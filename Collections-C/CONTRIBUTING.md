# Contributing

To get started, fork the repository to your account and then clone your fork to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Collections-C.git
```
You can now start working on the project, but before you do, here are some general guidelines that will make contributing a lot easier:

* if you wish to work on some major new feature, it's usually a good idea to open an issue first, so that it can be discussed
* when writing code, follow the code [K&R code fomatting style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style) using 4 space indentation. In general, make sure that the code you write is formatted in the same way that everything else is formatted.
* if you are writing some new code that is not covered by the tests, try to write tests for it too
* before commiting your changes make sure that the project builds correctly and that the tests are passing

After you're done working on your changes, commit your work and push it to your fork.

You can then open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your fork to the upstream repository. After the pull request is made, we will comment / review it and might also suggest some changes. After all that is done, the pull request is merged.

## Synchronizing your fork with the upstream
You might have forked the repository a while ago, and in the meantime some changes were added to the upstream repository. Now if you want to send a Pull Request you might run into merge issues. To solve this issue make sure you have your fork synchronized with the upstream repository before you make any changes. 

To synchronize your fork, you first need to clone it if you don't already have a local copy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Collections-C.git
```
then add the upstream repository as a remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C.git
```
finally pull from the upstream into your local master branch
```bash
git pull upstream master
```
In case you have already done some work you might want to `fetch` instead of `pull`
```bash
git fetch upstream
```
and once you sort out your current work, merge it into you master branch
```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

## Finding something to work on
There is always something to work on, be it fixing bugs, writing documentation or adding cool new features. You can start by looking through the [issues](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/issues) to find something interesting.
If you have a cool new idea, or you've found a bug and there is no issue for it, go ahead and open a [new issue](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/issues/new) for it.

If you're just starting out, look for issues with a [low-hanging fruit](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22low-hanging+fruit%22) tag. These issues should be fairly easy to fix, and they are also a good starting point for contributing.
